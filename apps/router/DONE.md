# 🎉 SETUP COMPLETE - YOU'RE READY!

## ✅ Everything is Done

Your Claude Code Router is fully set up and ready to use!

### What's Configured

1. ✅ **Workers Deployed**

   - URL: https://claude-code-router-1016.moonboylabs.workers.dev
   - Status: Live and responding
   - Authentication: Enabled and tested

2. ✅ **Secrets Set**

   - APIKEY: Secure 64-char key
   - OPENROUTER_API_KEY: Your OpenRouter key
   - CONFIG_JSON: Full configuration

3. ✅ **Claude Code Configured**

   - File: `~/.claude/settings.json`
   - Points to your router
   - API key configured

4. ✅ **Models Available**
   - `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5` (default)
   - `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5` (thinking)
   - `z-ai/glm-4.6` (background)
   - `openai/gpt-5-codex` (coding)

## 🚀 Start Using Now!

**Important**: If you were logged into Claude Code before, logout first:

```bash
claude /logout
```

Then just open Claude Code and start chatting - it's already configured!

All your requests will:

1. Go to your Workers endpoint
2. Be authenticated with your API key
3. Route to the appropriate model based on task type
4. Use OpenRouter to access the models

## 📊 Monitor Usage

```bash
# Watch live requests
npx wrangler tail

# Check OpenRouter usage
# Visit: https://openrouter.ai/activity
```

## 🔐 Your Credentials

**Location**: `apps/router/.credentials`

**Router API Key**: `3b9308aec547b2b7f2329f594b3a652ccc6b3478b2cbde93d1b0f62d7c38c307`

⚠️ Keep this secret! It's already in `.gitignore`

## 🧪 Quick Test

```bash
# Test the endpoint
curl https://claude-code-router-1016.moonboylabs.workers.dev/

# Test with auth
curl -X POST https://claude-code-router-1016.moonboylabs.workers.dev/v1/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: 3b9308aec547b2b7f2329f594b3a652ccc6b3478b2cbde93d1b0f62d7c38c307" \
  -d '{
    "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5",
    "max_tokens": 50,
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say hi!"}]
  }'
```

## 🎯 What Happens When You Use Claude Code

1. You ask Claude Code a question
2. Claude Code sends request to your router
3. Router authenticates with your API key
4. Router determines which model to use based on:
   - Task type (default/thinking/background/etc)
   - Context length
   - Your routing rules
5. Router forwards to OpenRouter
6. OpenRouter calls the actual model
7. Response comes back through the chain
8. You see the result in Claude Code

## 💰 Cost Savings

Your router automatically uses:

- **Claude Haiku 4.5** for most requests (cheapest)
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** only when needed (thinking/reasoning)
- **GLM-4.6** for background tasks (even cheaper)

This can save you significant costs vs always using Sonnet!

## 🔧 Customization

Want to change routing rules? Edit `apps/router/config.json`:

```json
{
  "Router": {
    "default": "openrouter,anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5",
    "think": "openrouter,anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5",
    "background": "openrouter,z-ai/glm-4.6",
    "longContext": "openrouter,anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5",
    "longContextThreshold": 60000
  }
}
```

Then update and redeploy:

```bash
# Update CONFIG_JSON in .dev.vars
# Then:
grep "^CONFIG_JSON=" .dev.vars | cut -d'=' -f2- | npx wrangler secret put CONFIG_JSON
bun run deploy:workers
```

## 🎊 You're All Set!

**Everything is working. Start using Claude Code now!**

No more setup needed - just use Claude Code normally and enjoy:

- ✅ Smart routing
- ✅ Cost optimization
- ✅ Secure authentication
- ✅ Full control over your API usage

**Happy coding! 🚀**
