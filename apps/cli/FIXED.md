# Fixed Issues

## What Was Wrong

1. **Path Resolution**: The CLI was using `import.meta.dir` which doesn't work correctly in compiled binaries
2. **zx Command Issues**: Using `cd ${path} && command` in zx was causing path resolution failures
3. **No Error Context**: Error messages didn't explain where the CLI was looking for files

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Smart Path Resolution

The `getRouterPath()` function now tries multiple locations:

```typescript
// If running from apps/cli
const fromCli = resolve(cwd, "..", "router");

// If running from project root
const fromRoot = resolve(cwd, "apps", "router");

// If running from apps/router
if (existsSync(join(cwd, "config.json"))) {
  return cwd;
}
```

### 2. Replaced zx with execa

Changed from:

```typescript
await $`cd ${routerPath} && bunx wrangler deploy`;
```

To:

```typescript
await execa("bunx", ["wrangler", "deploy"], {
  cwd: routerPath,
});
```

This is more reliable and doesn't require shell command chaining.

### 3. Better Error Messages

Now shows helpful context:

```
Config file not found at /router/config.json

Current directory: /some/wrong/path
Please run this CLI from either:
  - Project root: /path/to/claude-code-setup
  - CLI directory: /path/to/claude-code-setup/apps/cli
```

## How to Use

1. **Rebuild** (if you haven't already):

   ```bash
   cd apps/cli
   bun run build
   ```

2. **Run from correct directory**:

   ```bash
   # From project root
   cd /path/to/claude-code-setup
   ccr

   # OR from apps/cli
   cd /path/to/claude-code-setup/apps/cli
   ccr
   ```

## Testing

All features should now work:

- ✅ View Configuration
- ✅ Select Models (fetches from OpenRouter API)
- ✅ Deploy to Workers (runs wrangler commands)
- ✅ Manage Secrets (sets/lists secrets)
