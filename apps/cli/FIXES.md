# Bug Fixes - Environment Loading and Deployment

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ OPENROUTER_API_KEY Not Found in Compiled Binary

**Problem**:

- CLI showed "OPENROUTER_API_KEY not found in environment" error when running the compiled binary from any directory outside the project
- The error occurred even though `.env` files existed in the correct locations

**Root Cause**:

- Compiled binaries don't auto-load `.env` files like `bun run` does
- Previous implementation used `process.execPath` to find the project root, but this points to the binary itself, not the source location
- When running from home directory (`~`), the path resolution failed completely

**Solution**:

- Use `import.meta.dir` instead of `process.execPath` to find the source location
- In Bun compiled binaries, `import.meta.dir` is embedded at compile time and points to the original source directory
- For `apps/cli/src/utils/env.ts`, `import.meta.dir` points to `apps/cli/src/utils`
- Navigate up the directory tree: `utils` → `src` → `cli` → `apps` → `project root`
- This works regardless of where the binary is executed from

**Technical Details**:

```typescript
// Before (broken):
const binaryPath = process.execPath; // Points to the binary itself
const projectRoot = resolve(binaryPath, "..", "..", "..");

// After (fixed):
const sourceDir = import.meta.dir; // Points to apps/cli/src/utils
const srcDir = resolve(sourceDir, ".."); // apps/cli/src
const cliDir = resolve(srcDir, ".."); // apps/cli
const appsDir = resolve(cliDir, ".."); // apps
const projectRoot = resolve(appsDir, ".."); // project root
```

**Files Changed**:

- `apps/cli/src/utils/env.ts` - Updated `findEnvFiles()` to use `import.meta.dir`

### 2. ✅ Invalid 'cwd' Option Error in Deployment

**Problem**:

- Deployment failed with error: "The 'cwd' option is invalid: /Users/sean/apps/router"
- Error showed: "ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/Users/sean/apps/router'"
- This happened when running the binary from home directory

**Root Cause**:

- `getRouterPath()` function used `process.cwd()` to find the router directory
- When running from home directory, it tried to resolve `../router` from `~`, resulting in `/Users/sean/apps/router`
- The wrangler command received an invalid path and failed

**Solution**:

- Applied the same `import.meta.dir` fix to `getRouterPath()`
- Now correctly finds the router directory regardless of execution location
- Added fallback to search up the directory tree if the primary method fails

**Technical Details**:

```typescript
// Before (broken):
const cwd = process.cwd(); // /Users/sean
const fromCli = resolve(cwd, "..", "router"); // /Users/sean/apps/router ❌

// After (fixed):
const sourceDir = import.meta.dir; // apps/cli/src/utils
const routerPath = resolve(sourceDir, "..", "..", "..", "router"); // apps/router ✅
```

**Files Changed**:

- `apps/cli/src/utils/config.ts` - Updated `getRouterPath()` to use `import.meta.dir`

## Why import.meta.dir Works in Compiled Binaries

According to Bun documentation:

- `import.meta.dir` is embedded at **compile time**
- It points to the **original source directory**, not the binary location
- This makes it perfect for finding project files relative to the source code
- Works consistently whether running with `bun run` or as a compiled binary

Example from Bun docs:

```typescript
import.meta.dir; // => "/path/to/project/src"
import.meta.file; // => "file.ts"
import.meta.path; // => "/path/to/project/src/file.ts"
```

## Testing

### Test 1: Environment Loading from Home Directory

```bash
cd ~
ccr
# Should load API key and show models
```

**Expected**: ✅ Models load successfully, no environment errors

### Test 2: Deployment from Home Directory

```bash
cd ~
ccr
# Select "Deploy to Workers"
# Select "Deploy Now"
```

**Expected**: ✅ Deployment succeeds, updates existing worker

### Test 3: Running from Project Root

```bash
cd /path/to/claude-code-setup
ccr
```

**Expected**: ✅ Everything works normally

### Test 4: Running from CLI Directory

```bash
cd /path/to/claude-code-setup/apps/cli
./dist/router-workers-cli
```

**Expected**: ✅ Everything works normally

## Verification Commands

```bash
# 1. Rebuild the binary
cd apps/cli
bun run build

# 2. Test from different directories
cd ~
/path/to/claude-code-setup/apps/cli/dist/router-workers-cli

cd /tmp
/path/to/claude-code-setup/apps/cli/dist/router-workers-cli

# 3. Verify deployment works
cd ~
ccr
# Select Deploy to Workers → Deploy Now
```

## Additional Improvements

### Fallback Path Resolution

Both `findEnvFiles()` and `getRouterPath()` now include multiple fallback strategies:

1. **Primary**: Use `import.meta.dir` (works in compiled binaries)
2. **Fallback 1**: Check relative to `process.cwd()` (works when running from project)
3. **Fallback 2**: Search up directory tree (works from subdirectories)
4. **Fallback 3**: Check common locations (apps/cli, apps/router, project root)

This ensures the CLI works in virtually any execution context.
