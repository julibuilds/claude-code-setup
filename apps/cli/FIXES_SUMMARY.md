# Advanced Configuration UI Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Table Component Layout Issues

**Problem**: Table rows were not properly sized and content was overflowing
**Fix**:

- Wrapped table content in `<scrollbox>` for proper scrolling
- Added proper flex properties (`flexShrink`, `flexGrow`) to columns
- Improved column width handling with fixed vs flexible columns
- Added proper text truncation for long content
- Added padding between header and data rows

### 2. Tab Component Layout Issues

**Problem**: Tab content was not properly contained and overflowing
**Fix**:

- Added `flexGrow={1}` to main container
- Added `flexShrink: 0` to tab list to prevent shrinking
- Added `overflow: "hidden"` to tab content area
- Improved focus indicators for active tabs

### 3. ModelBrowser Component Issues

**Problem**: Controls were not properly sized and table was not scrollable
**Fix**:

- Added explicit heights to control boxes (`height: 3`, `height: 6`)
- Wrapped router selection in `<scrollbox>` for long lists
- Added `flexShrink: 0` to controls and help sections
- Added `minHeight: 10` to table container
- Improved column widths and text truncation

### 4. ProviderManager Component Issues

**Problem**: Provider details were not scrollable and layout was cramped
**Fix**:

- Added `<scrollbox>` to provider details section
- Added `flexShrink: 0` to header and help sections
- Added `minHeight: 8` to providers table
- Fixed potential undefined transformer property access

### 5. ConfigSummary Component Issues

**Problem**: Long configuration sections were not scrollable
**Fix**:

- Wrapped sections in `<scrollbox>` for proper scrolling
- Added `flexShrink: 0` to header and help sections
- Added visual highlight for selected section when focused

### 6. SearchInput Component Issues

**Problem**: Search input was not taking full available width
**Fix**:

- Added `flexGrow: 1` to container for proper width expansion

## Key Improvements

1. **Proper Scrolling**: All long content areas now use `<scrollbox>` components
2. **Better Layout**: Proper use of `flexGrow`, `flexShrink`, and explicit dimensions
3. **Improved Focus**: Better visual indicators for focused elements
4. **Text Handling**: Proper truncation for long text content
5. **Responsive Design**: Components adapt better to different terminal sizes

## Testing

The fixes have been applied and the components should now:

- Display properly without layout overflow
- Allow scrolling through long lists of models and providers
- Show clear focus indicators
- Handle text truncation gracefully
- Maintain proper proportions across different screen sizes
