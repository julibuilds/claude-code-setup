# Quick Fix Guide

## What Was Fixed

Two critical bugs in the compiled CLI binary:

1. **Environment variables not loading** - CLI couldn't find `.env` files when run from outside the project
2. **Deployment failing** - Invalid path error when deploying from home directory

## The Solution

Changed from using `process.execPath` to `import.meta.dir` for path resolution.

### Why This Works

In Bun compiled binaries:

- `process.execPath` → points to the binary itself (unreliable)
- `import.meta.dir` → embedded at compile time, points to source directory (reliable)

## How to Apply the Fix

```bash
# 1. Navigate to CLI directory
cd apps/cli

# 2. Rebuild the binary
bun run build

# 3. Test from any directory
cd ~
ccr
```

## What Changed

### apps/cli/src/utils/env.ts

```typescript
// Before:
const binaryPath = process.execPath;

// After:
const sourceDir = import.meta.dir;
const projectRoot = resolve(sourceDir, "..", "..", "..", "..");
```

### apps/cli/src/utils/config.ts

```typescript
// Before:
const cwd = process.cwd();
const routerPath = resolve(cwd, "..", "router");

// After:
const sourceDir = import.meta.dir;
const routerPath = resolve(sourceDir, "..", "..", "..", "router");
```

## Testing

```bash
# Test 1: Run from home
cd ~
ccr
# Should show models, no environment errors

# Test 2: Deploy from home
cd ~
ccr
# Select "Deploy to Workers" → "Deploy Now"
# Should deploy successfully

# Test 3: Run from anywhere
cd /tmp
ccr
# Should work normally
```

- `FIXES.md` - Detailed bug report and resolution
- `README.md` - Updated usage instructions

## Verification

After rebuilding, the binary should:

- ✅ Load environment variables from any directory
- ✅ Find router config from any directory
- ✅ Deploy successfully from any directory
- ✅ Work without any path configuration
