ALL package and app source files (_.tsx, _.ts, etc.) must adhere to a STRICT limit of 450 lines of code. If files exceed this length, split the code into multiple files to make them more manageable. E.g. if a single file contains 1255 lines of code, consider creating a folder for its features/functionality with its code split into 3-4 separate files within the folder.
