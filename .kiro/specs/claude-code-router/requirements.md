# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a Claude Code Router/Proxy system within a Turborepo monorepo. The system enables users to route Claude Code requests to multiple LLM providers (with OpenRouter as a priority), supporting both local Docker deployment and Cloudflare Workers deployment. The implementation leverages Bun, TypeScript, and Hono to create a flexible, extensible routing infrastructure with an optional web-based management interface.

## Glossary

- **Router Service**: The core proxy service that intercepts Claude Code API requests and routes them to configured LLM providers
- **Provider**: An external LLM API service (e.g., OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Ollama, Gemini) that the Router Service can forward requests to
- **Transformer**: A plugin component that modifies request/response payloads to ensure compatibility between Claude's API format and different provider formats
- **Routing Rule**: Configuration that determines which Provider and model to use based on request characteristics (e.g., background tasks, reasoning tasks, long context)
- **Web Management UI**: A Next.js-based web application for configuring and monitoring the Router Service
- **Core Library**: A shared TypeScript package containing common utilities, types, and transformers used by both the Router Service and Web Management UI
- **Deployment Target**: The runtime environment where the Router Service executes (either Docker container or Cloudflare Workers)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Claude Code, I want to route my API requests to OpenRouter and other providers, so that I can use alternative LLM models without modifying my Claude Code setup

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Claude Code API request is received, THE Router Service SHALL forward the request to the configured Provider based on active routing rules
2. THE Router Service SHALL support OpenRouter as a primary Provider with full API compatibility
3. THE Router Service SHALL transform request payloads from Claude API format to the target Provider's expected format
4. THE Router Service SHALL transform response payloads from the Provider's format back to Claude API format
5. WHEN a request fails at the configured Provider, THE Router Service SHALL return an appropriate error response to the client

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy the router service using Docker or Cloudflare Workers, so that I can choose the deployment option that best fits my infrastructure

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Router Service SHALL execute successfully in a Docker container environment
2. THE Router Service SHALL execute successfully as a Cloudflare Worker
3. THE Router Service SHALL read configuration from environment variables in both Deployment Targets
4. THE Router Service SHALL use Hono framework for HTTP request handling in both Deployment Targets
5. THE Router Service SHALL provide identical API behavior across both Deployment Targets

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure multiple providers with different routing rules, so that I can optimize cost and performance by using different models for different task types

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Router Service SHALL load provider configurations from a JSON configuration file
2. THE Router Service SHALL support routing rules for default, background, reasoning, long context, and web search task types
3. WHEN a request matches a specific Routing Rule, THE Router Service SHALL route to the Provider and model specified in that rule
4. WHEN a request does not match any specific Routing Rule, THE Router Service SHALL route to the default Provider and model
5. THE Router Service SHALL allow dynamic model switching via special command syntax in request content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer integrating the router, I want a shared core library with common utilities and types, so that I can maintain consistency across different components of the system

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Core Library SHALL export TypeScript type definitions for Provider configurations, Routing Rules, and API request/response formats
2. THE Core Library SHALL provide utility functions for environment variable interpolation
3. THE Core Library SHALL include base Transformer implementations for common providers
4. THE Core Library SHALL be consumable as a package dependency by both the Router Service and Web Management UI
5. THE Core Library SHALL use Bun as the package manager and runtime

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to extend the router with custom transformers, so that I can add support for new providers or customize existing provider integrations

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Router Service SHALL load custom Transformer modules from file paths specified in configuration
2. THE Router Service SHALL apply Transformers to requests before forwarding to Providers
3. THE Router Service SHALL apply Transformers to responses before returning to clients
4. THE Router Service SHALL support chaining multiple Transformers for a single Provider
5. THE Router Service SHALL pass configuration options to Transformers during initialization

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a web-based UI to manage router configuration, so that I can easily view and modify settings without editing JSON files manually

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Web Management UI SHALL display current Provider configurations in a readable format
2. THE Web Management UI SHALL display current Routing Rules in a readable format
3. THE Web Management UI SHALL allow adding new Providers through form inputs
4. THE Web Management UI SHALL allow modifying existing Routing Rules through interactive controls
5. THE Web Management UI SHALL save configuration changes to the Router Service's configuration file

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the router to handle streaming responses, so that I can receive real-time output from LLM providers

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Provider returns a streaming response, THE Router Service SHALL forward the stream to the client without buffering the entire response
2. THE Router Service SHALL transform streaming response chunks from Provider format to Claude API format
3. THE Router Service SHALL handle stream interruptions gracefully and close connections properly
4. THE Router Service SHALL support Server-Sent Events (SSE) format for streaming responses
5. WHEN a stream encounters an error, THE Router Service SHALL send an appropriate error event to the client

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security-conscious administrator, I want to protect the router service with API key authentication, so that only authorized clients can use the service

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHERE API key authentication is enabled, THE Router Service SHALL reject requests without a valid API key
2. THE Router Service SHALL accept API keys in the Authorization header with Bearer scheme
3. THE Router Service SHALL accept API keys in the x-api-key header
4. WHERE API key authentication is not configured, THE Router Service SHALL bind only to localhost for security
5. THE Router Service SHALL log authentication failures for security monitoring

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring, so that I can troubleshoot issues and understand system behavior

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Router Service SHALL log all incoming API requests with timestamp, method, and path
2. THE Router Service SHALL log routing decisions including selected Provider and model
3. THE Router Service SHALL log request/response transformation events
4. THE Router Service SHALL support configurable log levels (fatal, error, warn, info, debug, trace)
5. WHERE logging is disabled in configuration, THE Router Service SHALL not create log files

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer using the Web Management UI, I want a modern, responsive interface built with Next.js 15 and React 19, so that I have a smooth user experience across devices

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Web Management UI SHALL use Next.js 15 with App Router architecture
2. THE Web Management UI SHALL use React 19 for component rendering
3. THE Web Management UI SHALL use Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
4. THE Web Management UI SHALL be responsive and functional on mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes
5. THE Web Management UI SHALL use the shared UI component library from the packages/ui workspace
