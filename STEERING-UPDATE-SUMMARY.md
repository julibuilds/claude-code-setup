### 3. `.kiro/steering/tech.md`

**Added**:

- CLI Stack section with all dependencies
- CLI Tool commands section
- Updated deployment section with CLI-first approach
- Complete "CLI Technical Details" section covering:
  - Path resolution in compiled binaries
  - File synchronization implementation
  - Caching strategy
  - OpenTUI framework usage
- "Important Bun Features Used" section covering:
  - Compiled binaries
  - Environment variables
  - File I/O

**Key Changes**:

- Added "CLI Stack" subsection under "Core Technologies"
- Added "CLI Tool" commands section
- Updated "Deployment" section to recommend CLI usage
- Added extensive "CLI Technical Details" section
- Added "Important Bun Features Used" section

## Key Technical Concepts Documented

### 1. Path Resolution with import.meta.dir

Explained why `import.meta.dir` is used instead of `process.execPath`:

- Embedded at compile time
- Points to source directory
- Works from any execution location
- Makes binary truly portable

### 2. File Synchronization

Documented the automatic sync behavior:

- Secrets → `.dev.vars` sync
- Pre/post deployment verification
- File status reporting in UI

### 3. Caching Strategy

Explained the model list caching:

- 24-hour TTL
- Cache location
- Force refresh capability
- Offline support

### 4. OpenTUI Framework

Documented key patterns:

- Focus management (only one focused component)
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Component usage
- Critical patterns to follow

### 5. Bun-Specific Features

Documented Bun features used:

- Compiled binaries with `--compile`
- Environment variable handling
- File I/O with `Bun.file()` and `Bun.write()`

## Benefits of These Updates

### For Developers

1. **Complete Picture**: Steering files now reflect the full project state
2. **Technical Guidance**: Clear explanations of key implementation decisions
3. **Best Practices**: Documented patterns for path resolution, file sync, and UI
4. **Quick Reference**: Easy to find information about CLI features and usage

### For AI Assistants (Kiro)

1. **Context Awareness**: Kiro now knows about CLI tool and its capabilities
2. **Technical Understanding**: Can provide accurate guidance on implementation
3. **File Relationships**: Understands how files sync between local and remote
4. **Command Knowledge**: Knows correct commands for CLI operations

### For New Contributors

1. **Onboarding**: Complete overview of project structure and tech stack
2. **Architecture**: Clear understanding of how components interact
3. **Conventions**: Documented code style and naming conventions
4. **Examples**: Code snippets showing key patterns

## What's Documented

### Product Level (product.md)

- ✅ What the CLI does (features)
- ✅ How it fits into the overall product
- ✅ User-facing capabilities
- ✅ Development workflow

### Structure Level (structure.md)

- ✅ Where CLI files are located
- ✅ Directory structure
- ✅ Important files and their purposes
- ✅ Build outputs and artifacts

### Technical Level (tech.md)

- ✅ Technologies used in CLI
- ✅ Implementation details
- ✅ Key technical decisions
- ✅ Code patterns and examples
- ✅ Bun-specific features

## Cross-References

The steering files now reference:

- `apps/cli/README.md` - Usage guide
- `apps/cli/FILE-SYNC.md` - File synchronization details
- `apps/cli/FIXES.md` - Bug fixes and resolutions
- `apps/cli/SOLUTION.md` - Technical implementation
- `apps/cli/TODO.md` - Planned features

## Consistency

All three files now:

- Use consistent terminology
- Reference the same version (v2.0.2)
- Explain the same features from different perspectives
- Cross-reference each other appropriately

## Next Steps

The steering files are now complete and up-to-date. Future updates should include:

1. **When CLI features change**: Update product.md with new capabilities
2. **When structure changes**: Update structure.md with new directories/files
3. **When tech stack changes**: Update tech.md with new dependencies/patterns
4. **When best practices emerge**: Add to tech.md conventions section

## Verification

To verify the updates are working:

1. Ask Kiro about CLI features - should know about Quick Config, file sync, etc.
2. Ask about path resolution - should explain `import.meta.dir` approach
3. Ask about deployment - should recommend using CLI
4. Ask about file locations - should know CLI is in `apps/cli/`

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - All steering files updated and consistent

The Kiro steering files now provide comprehensive guidance about:

- Product capabilities and features
- Project structure and organization
- Technical implementation and patterns
- Development workflow and best practices
